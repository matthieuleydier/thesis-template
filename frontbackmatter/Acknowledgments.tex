\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I am grateful to my thesis supervisor, Ettore Zaffaroni, and my referees, Prof. Olivier Schneider and Guido Haefeli, who guided me throughout the entire project. Their counsel and insights have been precious in completing this work.

The LPHE has been an important place during this master program, and I express my gratitude to every member of the laboratory for their participation in the life of this group.

I would like to thank my parents for their unconditional support throughout the years. My friends and family have always been there when needed, and I am more than grateful to them.
